# German Learning Tracker

Welcome to my **German Learning Tracker**! This repository is dedicated to documenting my daily progress in learning German. My goal is to improve my vocabulary, grammar, and fluency by consistently adding new content every day.

## 📌 Structure
Each day, I will add:
- 📄 A PDF covering a new theme (e.g., travel, food, work-related vocabulary).
- 📝 Five new German words with their meanings and example sentences.
- 💬 Three commonly used sentences with translations.
